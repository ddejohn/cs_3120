# CS3120 Final Project Report
Devon DeJohn, Spring 2020

## Requirements
In order to run these files you will need `keras`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `opencv`, and the abililty to read and write digits.

## To run
Simply run `number_predictor.py` in a terminal at the directory where you place the files after downloading/cloning. 

A window will appear in which you can draw on a black background. Draw a digit, press `enter` on your keyboard, and the model will guess which digit you drew. The prediction will print in the terminal.

To exit the program, press `esc` on your keyboard.

## Improvements
This model sucks at identifying zeros.
