# CS3120 Final Project Report
Devon DeJohn, Spring 2020

## Requirements
This project uses `keras`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, and `opencv`.

## To run
Wherever you unzipped the files, simply run `number_predictor.py` in your terminal of choice.

A window will appear in which you can draw on a square black background. To exit the program, press `esc` on your keyboard. To have the predictor guess which number you drew, press `enter`. The prediction will print in the terminal.

## Improvements
This model sucks at identifying zeros.
